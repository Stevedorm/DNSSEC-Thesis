\section{VM Research}

I have never dealt directly with Virtual Machines before, and building a network of them was something I had never really thought about. However, the thought excited me 
and it seemed like a great opportunity to learn a new skill. Setting up the first one was a bit of a learning curve, but after setting up the first one to the specifications I wanted,
I was able to clone the rest as needed.

The software I used to set up the testbed network for my DNSSEC program was VMWare Workstation. This software made it very easy to set up the virtual machines and network. Having a built in option to create a virtual
network was very nice. I was also able to connect to the internet and download the necessary tools I needed, like Bind9, VMWare Tools, Wireshark, gcc and more.

\section{VM Network}

On VM Workstation, it is very easy and simple to set up a Virtual Network. Under the "Edit" tab in the menu, I was able to create a new vmnet and customize it to my needs. I made a custom network, isolated from the outside networks. The IP I used
was 192.168.107.X, with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. The 192.168 is an IP reserved for local networks, so this was perfect for me to to use. There was an option to enable or disable DHCP service. Enabling it meant that you could let DCHP assign 
addresses to machines on the network. For me, I wanted to statically and manually assign IPs without and DHCP intervention, so I deselected this option.

\section{Bind9}

I installed Bind9 on all of the VMs in the Virtual Network. The version I installed was 9.18.39 (check). I decided on Bind9 because it was a good option to be used on Ubuntu machines and gave me the control I wanted.
